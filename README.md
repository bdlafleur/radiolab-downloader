# radiolab-downloader
 
I like to have physical copies of my media files instead of streaming and I couldn't find an archive of Radiolab episodes to easily download so I wrote this little program to automatically download some or all episodes. You can set a start and stop page as well as a threshold to detect the end of the episode pages. It detects existing files so it won't re-downloadd them if you restart the downloading process. To change the parameters just edit the file. Have fun!
