# radiolab-downloader
 
I like to have physical copies of my media files instead of streaming and I couldn't find an archive of Radiolab episodes to easily download so I wrote this little program to automatically download some or all episodes. You can set a start and stop page as well as a threshold to detect the end of the episode pages. It has black and white list options. It detects existing files so it won't re-download them if you restart the downloading process. It downloads the mp3 files to the same directory as the py file. To change the parameters just edit the file.

Used libs are requests, BeautifulSoup4, os and re.



Have fun!
